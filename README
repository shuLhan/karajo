Module karajo implement HTTP workers and manager, similar to cron but works
only on HTTP.

karajo has the web user interface (WUI) for monitoring the jobs that run on
URL http://127.0.0.1:31937/karajo by default and can be configurable.

A single instance of karajo is configured through code or a configuration file
using ini file format.

Features,

* Running job on specific interval
* Preserve the job states on restart
* Able to pause and resume specific job
* Receiving hook and running commands
* HTTP APIs to programmatically interact with karajo

Work flow on karajo,

[#config]
== Configuration

This section describe the file format when loading karajo environment from
file.

There are three configuration sections: one to configure the server, one to
configure the logs, and another one to configure one or more jobs to be
executed.

Default values,

* `DefaultMaxRequests`: 1

[#config_server]
=== Server

This section has the following format,

----
[karajo]

dir_base = <path>
dir_public = <path>
secret = <string>
max_hook_running = <number>
----

`name`:: Define the name of the service.
+
--
It will be used for title on the web user interface, as log prefix, for file
prefix on the jobs state, and as file prefix on log files.
If this value is empty, it will be set to "karajo".
--

`listen_address`:: Define the address for WUI, default to ":31937".

`http_timeout`:: Define the HTTP timeout when executing the job, default to 5
minutes.
The value of this option is using the Go time.Duration format, for example,
30s for 30 seconds, 1m for 1 minute.

`dir_base`:: Define the base directory where configuration, job state, and log
stored.
+
--
This field is optional, default to current directory.
The structure of directory follow the UNIX system,

----
$DirBase
|
+-- /etc/karajo/karajo.conf
|
+-- /var/lib/karajo/hook/$Job.ID
|
+-- /var/log/karajo +-- /hook/$Hook.id
|                   |

"karajo".
--

`secret`:: Define the secret to authorize the incoming request through
signature.
+
--
Each request sign the payload (query string or body) with HMAC + SHA-256 using
this secret.
