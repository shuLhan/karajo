Module karajo implement HTTP workers and manager, similar to cron but works
only on HTTP.

karajo has the web user interface (WUI) for monitoring the jobs that run on
URL http://127.0.0.1:31937/karajo by default and can be configurable.

A single instance of karajo is configured through code or a configuration file
using ini file format.

Features,

* Running job on specific interval
* Preserve the job states on restart
* Able to pause and resume specific job
* HTTP APIs to programmatically interact with karajo

Work flow on karajo,

[#config]
== Configuration

This section describe the file format when loading karajo environment from
file.

There are three configuration sections: one to configure the server, one to
configure the logs, and another one to configure one or more jobs to be
executed.

[#config_server]
=== Server

This section has the following format,

----
[karajo]
name = <string>
listen_address = [<ip>:<port>]
http_timeout = [<duration>]
dir_base = <path>
dir_public = <path>
secret = <string>
----

The "name" option define the name of the service.
It will be used for title on the web user interface, as log prefix, for file
prefix on the jobs state, and as file prefix on log files.
If this value is empty, it will be set to "karajo".

The "listen_address" define the address for WUI, default to ":31937".

The "http_timeout" define the HTTP timeout when executing the job, default to
5 minutes.
The value of this option is using the Go time.Duration format, for example,
30s for 30 seconds, 1m for 1 minute.

The "dir_base" option define the base directory where configuration, job
state, and log stored.
This field is optional, default to current directory.
The structure of directory follow the UNIX system,

----
$DirBase
|
+-- /etc/karajo/karajo.conf
|
+-- /var/lib/karajo/hook/$Job.ID
|
+-- /var/log/karajo +-- /hook/$Hook.id
|                   |
|                   +-- /job/$Job.ID
|
+-- /var/run/karajo +-- /job/$Job.ID
----

Each job log stored under directory /var/log/karajo/job and the job state
under directory /var/run/karajo/job.

The "dir_public" option define a path to serve to the public.
While the WUI is served under "/karajo", a directory dir_public will be served
under "/".
A dir_public can contains sub directory as long as its name is not
"karajo".

The "secret" field define a string to check signature of request.
Each request sign the payload (query string or body) with HMAC + SHA-256 using
this secret.
The signature then sent in HTTP header "x-karajo-sign" as hex.
This field is required.


[#config_hook]
===  Hook

Hook is the HTTP endpoint that run a function or list of commands upon
receiving request.

The hook configuration have the following format,

----
[hook "<name>"]
description = <string>
path = <string>
secret = <string>
log_retention = <number>
command = <string>
...

The hook name is used for logging, normalized to ID.
This field is required and should unique between Hook.

The "description" field define the hook description.
It could be plain text or simple HTML.

The "path" field set HTTP path where Karajo will listen for request.
The `path` is automatically prefixed with "/karajo/hook", it is not
static.
For example, if it set to "/my", then the actual path would be
"/karajo/hook/my".
This field is required and unique between Hook.

The "secret" field define a string to check signature of request.
Each request sign the body with HMAC + SHA-256 using this secret.
The signature then sent in HTTP header "x-karajo-sign" as hex.
This field is required.

The "log_retention" option define the maximum number of logs to keep in
storage.
This field is optional, default to 5.

The "command" field contains list of command to be executed, in order from top
to bottom.

The following environment variables are available inside the command:

* KARAJO_HOOK_COUNTER: contains the current hook counter.


[#config_job]
=== Job

This section has the following format,

----
[karajo "job"]
name = <string>
description = <string>
secret = <string>
interval = <duration>

http_method = [GET|POST|PUT|DELETE]
http_url = <URL>
http_request_type = [query|form|json]
http_header = <string ":" string>
http_insecure = <bool>
----

The "name" option define the job name.
Each job must have unique name or only the first one will be processed.

The "description" field define the job description.
It could be plain text or simple HTML.

The "secret" option define a string to sign the request query or body with
HMAC+SHA-256.
The signature is sent on HTTP header "x-karajo-sign" as hex string.
This field is optional.

The "interval" option define the duration when job will be repeatedly
executed.
This field is required, if not set or invalid it will set to 30 seconds.
If one have job that need to run less than 30 seconds, it should be run on
single program.

The "http_method" define the HTTP method used to request job execution.
Its accept only GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE.
This field is optional, default to GET.

The "http_url" define the HTTP URL where the job will be executed.
This field is required.

The "http_request_type" define the header Content-Type to be set on request.
Its accept,

* query: no header Content-Type to be set, reserved for future use;
* form: header Content-Type set to "application/x-www-form-urlencoded";
* json: header Content-Type set to "application/json".

The type "form" and "json" only applicable if the method is POST or PUT.
This field is optional, default to query.

The "http_header" option define optional HTTP headers that will send when
executing the "http_url".
This option can be declared more than one.

The "http_insecure" option can be set to true if the "http_url" is HTTPS with
unknown certificate authority.

Each Job execution send the parameter named `_karajo_epoch` with value is
current server Unix time.
If the request type is `query` then the parameter is inside the query URL.
If the request type is `form` then the parameter is inside the body.
If the request type is `json` then the parameter is inside the body as JSON
object, for example `{"_karajo_epoch":1656750073}`.
